** what might be preventing it from working is the files you deleted from
the source folder (look at spotify auth github)

- if the user is playing a song
>> body_text
item.artists.name[] <- list all of them (make sure to account for a lot)
item.album.name 
item.album.images[0]
item.album.release_date
item.name

have home page that has a signin button that leads you to login
change call back to actual song page after auth

npm init
npm install --save body-parser express cors react-router-dom cookie-parser genius-lyrics-api node-fetch querystring request


steps:
1) user logins in with original '/' url
2) goes to callback url and redirects automatically
3) is redirects to actual lyric component that calls fetch on 'np' with component did mount

!! FOR CORS ISSUE: 
1) Win + R
2) chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

todo:
 - make home page
 - route homepage to login
 - redirect login to lyrics page'
 - takeout inline styling in index.html

 - song info given at 3001/np
 - have login reroute to lyrics
