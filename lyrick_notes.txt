** what might be preventing it from working is the files you deleted from
the source folder (look at spotify auth github)

- if the user is playing a song
>> body_text
item.artists.name[] <- list all of them (make sure to account for a lot)
item.album.name 
item.album.images[0]
item.album.release_date
item.name

have home page that has a signin button that leads you to login
change call back to actual song page after auth

npm init
npm install --save body-parser express cors react-router-dom cookie-parser genius-lyrics-api node-fetch querystring request


steps:
1) user logins in with original '/' url
2) goes to callback url and redirects automatically
3) is redirects to actual lyric component that calls fetch on 'np' with component did mount
